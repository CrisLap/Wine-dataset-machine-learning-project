## Machine Learning Pipeline - general info
In this machine learning project, you have to train a single learning model (of your choice, as long as it has at least one hyper-parameter to validate) and evaluate its performance.
You have to comment the code, motivating the steps and choices made.  
The Wine dataset (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#wine-recognition-dataset) can be downloaded directly from Scikit-learn. The dataset contains the results of chemical analysis of wines produced by three different Italian growers: you have to understand the type of wine from its chemical values.

Notes: 
I suggest to open the notebook with nbviewer at this link: <br>
https://nbviewer.org/github/CrisLap/Wine-dataset-machine-learning-project/blob/main/Wine%20dataset%20machine%20learning%20project.ipynb <br>

Finally I create a web app with streamlit and an executable file( .py). With this app the users can fill different values for each features and the algotihm predict the class label <br>
You can reach the application here: https://crislap-wine-dataset-machine-lear-wineclasspredictionapp-vr6owl.streamlit.app
