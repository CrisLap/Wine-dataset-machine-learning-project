## Machine Learning Pipeline - general info
In this machine learning project, I have to train a single learning model (of my choice, as long as it has at least one hyper-parameter to validate) and evaluate its performance.
I have to comment the code, motivating the steps and choices made.  
The Wine dataset (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#wine-recognition-dataset) can be downloaded directly from Scikit-learn. The dataset contains the results of chemical analysis of wines produced by three different Italian growers: I have to understand the type of wine from its chemical values.
